# TimeStopPower
I got inspired one day to play around with Shader Graph, and I decided to use it to make this time stopping power from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
I also played around with some other shaders, like dissolving, and may try out some others in the future.

Sound effects are ripped from the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime, I do not own them.

This article was majorly helpful in getting custom post processing effects working in URP, big thanks to Febucci: https://www.febucci.com/2022/05/custom-post-processing-in-urp/
